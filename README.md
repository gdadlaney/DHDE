# Decentralized-Healthcare-Data-Exchange
A Healthcare Data Exchange that enables exchange of patient health records, particularly CCDAs between EHRs using blockchain. Since, the data is exchanged in a decentralized way, any EHR from any location can join the exchange network. The system is designed to be a decentralized alternative to the centralized HIE system in the US.
